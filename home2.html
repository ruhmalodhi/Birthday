    <h1>Happy 25th Birthday</h1>
    <p>You're one of those people who is very close to my heart. i dont think i can ever express with words how much i love you. I fall in love with you deeper and deeper every day and can you blame me tho? look at you. You are everything a girl could ask for. Accutally screw other girls you are everything i asked for. I am so sorry for ever hurting you. I am so sorry for any pain you have ever felt. If i could i would take all your pain away and never let you get hurt and i pray that may all your share of sorrows be in my destiny. I know that you are probably very stressed to even celebrate your birthday because of the exam but if you can please for me try not to stress too much today after all this is your 25th birthday you are like almost 50. I know you are worried about your exam but i know you know and Allah knows how hard you studied for it and Allah will never let your hardwork go to waste. Have faith in him and it will be all ok. Sometimes i do think like is there anything that i would want in my husband that hishaam doesnt have (minus the shit i say when i am angry) and the answer is no. You are perfect for me the way you are and i can't thank Allah enough for making you my soulmate. And i have probably already said this a milion times but i will say it again one thing that i love the most about you is you calmness. It makes me feel so safe and protected around you. You mean so much to me. You bring so much joy and happiness into my life. I am extremely grateful for spending these past two years with you and im so excited to spend the rest of my life in your arms. You are a beautiful person inside out. I pray that all your dreams come and you achieve all your goals. i will always be there for you. I will forever be your number one Fan (and hater too). You have healed parts of me that you didnt hurt. The only reason why i stopped playing fruit ninja on my body is you. I cant wait for us to get married and i can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. I love you more than word can say. I also want to remind you of all the little things that make our relationship so special. The way you laugh at my jokes because im so funny, your thoughtful gestures, and the little moments like complimenting my eyes hair and smile and making your lame ass jokes every 2 damn second and the weird faces you make they mean the world to me. You were always there for me during my supid little break downs. You believed in me when i myself thought i was a loser. Your support and belief in me have given me strength during my weakest moments. Together, we can face anything that comes our way because we have each other. I love your cute eyes and your cute lips and your cute smile and your cute face and your cute hair and your cute hands and your cute organs and basically everything about you. I really hope you have an amazing day and inshallah your exam goes well. You mean the world to me. You're my rock and i love so freaking much. Happy Birthday My Perfect Man.</p>
